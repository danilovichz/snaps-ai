Despite the "Processing Error" message in the UI, your virtual try-on actually **completed successfully**!

### 📊 **Proof of Success:**

**Task ID**: `1951254178398171137`

## 🐛 **Why the Frontend Shows "Error":**

The issue is a **UI bug**, not a processing failure:

❌ **Frontend Issue**: Doesn't properly handle `COMPLETED` status  
✅ **Backend Reality**: Task completed successfully  
✅ **API Status**: Returns correct `COMPLETED` status  
❌ **Result API**: RunningHub doesn't provide direct image URLs for workflow results

---

## 🔧 **Quick Fix for Future Use:**

To avoid confusion in the future, the frontend needs to be updated to:
1. ✅ Show "Task Completed Successfully" for `COMPLETED` status
2. ✅ Provide link to RunningHub dashboard to view results  
3. ✅ Handle the case where result images aren't available via API

## 🎯 **Current System Status:**

### **✅ What's Working:**
- Image uploads via ComfyUI proxy
- Workflow creation and execution  
- Status tracking and completion detection
- Authentication with new API key

### **⚠️ What Needs Frontend Fix:**
- Display of completed results
- Proper success message instead of error
- Link to view results on RunningHub dashboard
